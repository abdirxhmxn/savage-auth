## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:
- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm or yarn installed
- A MongoDB Atlas account (the free tier works perfectly)

### Installation Steps

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdirxhmxn/21-savage-fan-site.git
cd 21-savage-fan-site
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Configure your database**

Open `config/database.js` and replace the connection string with your own MongoDB Atlas credentials:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  'url': 'mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/21savage?retryWrites=true&w=majority',
  'dbName': '21savage'
};
```

**4. Start the server**
```bash
node server.js
```

**5. Visit the site**

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## How It Works

### User Journey

The app follows a straightforward flow: visitors land on the homepage where they can choose to sign up or log in. Once authenticated, users gain access to their profile page where they can post messages, interact with other posts through likes and dislikes, and manage their own content. All interactions happen in real-time without requiring page refreshes.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                    |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`               | Home page                      |
| GET    | `/login`          | Login form                     |
| POST   | `/login`          | Authenticate user              |
| GET    | `/signup`         | Signup form                    |
| POST   | `/signup`         | Create new account             |
| GET    | `/profile`        | User dashboard (protected)     |
| GET    | `/logout`         | End session                    |
| POST   | `/messages`       | Create new message             |
| PUT    | `/messages`       | Increment vote count           |
| PUT    | `/messagesDown`   | Decrement vote count           |
| DELETE | `/delete`         | Remove message                 |

### Security

The application takes security seriously. All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. User sessions are managed securely with express-session, and protected routes require authentication middleware. The app also implements flash messages for user feedback and secure cookie handling.
